# Odin Recipes

This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum.  
Itâ€™s a basic recipe website built with HTML.  

By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated skills in:
- Using Git and GitHub for version control
- Structuring HTML documents
- Creating and linking multiple web pages
- Writing clear project documentation
